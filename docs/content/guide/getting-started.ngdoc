You have a few options for getting the javascript you need.

```

* b. You can simply download it from github:

[http://raw.github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly/master/angular-scrolly.js](http://raw.github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly/master/angular-scrolly.js)

* c. You can clone the repository and build it. See the [project README](http://github.com/ajoslin/angular-scrolly).

#### 2. Include the javascript file in your HTML and as an angular dependency.

<pre>
<script src="angular-scrolly.js"></script>
</pre>
<pre>
angular.module('myAwesomeApp', ['ajoslin.scrolly']);
</pre>

#### 3. Throw in a `scrolly-scroll` directive
